\section{Professional Experience}

%\subsection{Vocational}

\cventry{09/2020--Present}{Associate Solutions Architect}{\textsc{Amazon Web Services}}{Milan}{}{
    My main role as a Solution Architect in AWS involved working directly with greenfield clients in the 
    retail space. I've presented AWS to multiple large Italian companies, and assisted them in developing 
    new applications on AWS or migrating parts of their infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud.
    \newline{}
    While working with AWS, the first 5 months were dedicated to studying the platform's services. I've personally 
    used multiple services like EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, RedShift, CloudWatch, S3, SNS, Amplify and GraphQL to name a few. 
    During this period I also developed a couple of file hosting services fully on AWS to fill in some missing 
    gaps in the tools we had at the time.

%------------------------------------------------

\cventry{05/2019--08/2020}{Programmer}{\textsc{Reply S.p.A}}{Turin}{}{
    Worked and lead on multiple projects for external clients. The majority of the time I worked as 
    an iOS developer and maintainer, developing a couple of apps while also managing launches along 
    with my couterparts on Android. I also worked as a backend developer on other projects, mainly 
    creating backends in node.js
\newline{}\newline{}
Detailed projects:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Beretta Firearms}
\newline
    My work on the Shooting Data project involved learning Objective-C 
    and then taking over the role of primary iOS developer on the app, alongside
    the role as maintainer of a parser for data collection. As maintainer of the parser, I had
    to interact directly with the clients, use the Azure IoT Hub, and update the parser written
    in java.
\item \textbf{Vodafone}
\newline
    For this project, I maintained the main backend in node.js for the Smart@Home Vodafone Platform. 
    This required managing multiple databases for each development environment and general maintenance 
    of the backend for push notifications. The main technologies used were node.js, MySQL, and multiple 
    AWS technologies such as SQS, SNS, ECS, RDS, etc.
\item \textbf{Fondazione Torino Musei}
\newline
    On this project, I was given the role of developing the iOS app and designing the backend with 
    Firebase Cloud Firestore. I also had the opportunity to study and implement some Firestore Cloud 
    Functions to keep the data synchonized.
\item \textbf{Caleffi}
\newline
    I worked as an iOS developer on the project, which required designing multiple API 
    calls to our backend, and to develop an interaction flow between a gateway and iPhone 
    via bluetooth commands.

\section{Personal Skills}
\cvitem{}{
    Ability and will to quickly learn new technologies. I was hired to work with Concept Reply
    as an iOS developer, while having no knowledge of Objective-C, Swift, or having ever
    used Xcode. By the first week I was developing portions of the app, and within 
    3 months I was able to work completly independently on a large
    project. After 5 months I was given complete control over the iOS app, including
    having to manage new releases on the app store. After 8 months working on
    the project, I was given complete control over the parser, where I've had to learn
    how to develop and manage one of the most vital parts of the project.
    \newline{}
    I've also developed good teamwork and relational skills by working in close contact with 
    other teammates on various projects, while also presenting or pitching our findings directly 
    to clients to get their feedback on solutions we were delivering.
